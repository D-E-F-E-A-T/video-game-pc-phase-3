# The Game Project, Stage 2
At release, this will be an fun and whimsical 2D/3D adventure game of the same genre as the original "Legend of Zelda."  Written in DirectX 11, C++, and XAML this continues the work of Stage 1 of this project.

Whereas the focus of Stage 1 was to develop core DirectX rendering functionality, Stage 2 develops a data model which is used to represent entities in the game world.  A world world map has been developed for the "outer world."  The player can now traverse through the multi-screen world.  A ServiceProxy project has been added which will connect to Web Services.

In Stage 3, the underworld will be developed which will include caves and dungeons.  Multi-screen functionality will be refined.  The ServiceProxy will connect to remote web services.  Gameplay, storyline, artwork will be further developed.
