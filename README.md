# The Game project, Phase 3
This is phase 3 of the Game project which implements a 2D/3D adventure game of the ilk of Nintendo's original "The Legend of Zelda." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(1986_video_game)

While many aspects of the look-and-feel and gameplay of the classic Zelda game will be kept in this version, I plan to add some of my own twists to the storyline.

As in the first two phases of this project, the code is developed with C++/XAML/DirectX 11.


Compilation
----------------------
Visual Studio 2015 (at least Community edition) and Windows 10 are required for compilation. 

Play
--------------------------------
The game can be played in the following ways:
1. Using and XBox One game controller (wired or wireless with wireless adapter)
2. On a tablet device in tablet mode (using on-screen touch controls)
3. Using the keyboard.
