# The Game project, Phase 3
This is phase 3 of the Game project which implements a 2D/3D adventure game of the ilk of Nintendo's original "The Legend of Zelda." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(1986_video_game)

This phase continues to build and define the data model and begins defining the dungeons of the world. The requirements of a scripting langauge begin to be identified. 
 
Up to this point, mechanical aspects of the game have been developed (i.e. placing sprites, movement of the player).  In the next phase, the rules of the game will start to take shape.

While many aspects of the look-and-feel and gameplay of the classic Zelda game will be kept in this version, I plan to add some of my own twists to the storyline.

The code is developed with C++/XAML/DirectX 11.
